  <h1>Preterm Baby Milestone Cards</h1>

  <p>Hello there!</p>

  <p>And welcome to the Dr Roo Milestone Cards.</p>

  <p>If you’re reading this card then you’ve most likely given birth to your baby early and they are requiring care in a neonatal nursery.</p>

  <p class="big"> You may have known your baby would arrive early, or it may have been completely unexpected. <br> Either way, you’re likely feeling a whole range of emotions, which may include joy, sadness, fear, anxiety, guilt, and anger.</p>

  <p class="big">These feelings can be overwhelming, and amongst the technical equipment and hospital staff helping care for your baby, you may feel helpless and unsure of your role as a parent. <br> These are all normal feelings and are felt by most parents who have a baby admitted to a neonatal nursery.

  <p class="big">As you navigate your way through what might feel like a roller coaster of emotions with ups and downs, it is my wish that the Dr Roo Milestone Cards are a gentle hug that help you celebrate your baby and the incredible developing they are doing, week by week.</p>

  <p class="big">You are so important to your baby and their wellbeing.</p>
  
  <p>On the back of each Dr Roo Milestone Card you will learn about your baby’s developing systems and ways you can provide care that supports their continued growth and development. </p>

  <p>You have a very important role in the neonatal nursery and as a parent to your baby.</p>

  <p>I’d love to hear what you think. Get in touch anytime with ideas, questions, additional milestone requests – or just to say hi!</p>
